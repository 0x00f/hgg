Testsuite
=========

Description:
------------
  A hgg subproject.
  This project is a testsuite for doing testdriven development on microcontrollers.
  It will be used to call buildscripts on firmware-code (using a makefile) and run 
  tests on it for different platforms. 
  It will take the platform information about the target microcontroller into account 
  and thus give a pseudo automatisation for the test-execution.
