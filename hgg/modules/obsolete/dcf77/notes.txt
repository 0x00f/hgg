About: DCF77-Time Hardware

Used for: 
 - time synchronisation between ground stations

Plan:
 - use to synchronize second marks
 - components of the ground station then count stuff with internal oscilators 
   and tick counts. 

Notes: 
 - dcf77 modules are very sensitive to bad voltages, good power source needed.
 - we have experienced problems with usb used as power supply


How to get it to work?

Use a Conrad DCF77 Module (Conrad, Article No:  641138-62). 
Set microcontroller internal pull up resistors to off. 
Use external pull up resistors for inverted and non inverted. R=47 kOhm . 47 kOhms works best.
Put inverted output of module to digital port 2 of arduino.
use 20 ycroFarrad between ground and Vcc on the module.
